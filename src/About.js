        Thinking of our world today makes me wonder about tomorrow, a year, a
        decade, or a century later. I look back at what we did in the past and
        what we have accomplished as a race, a human race. It makes me realize
        how much can happen in a matter of years. What will happen in this next
        century? How advance will are technologies be then? How much of the
        world, as we know it, still be around? Will us humans be the same? We
        have changed in the years. Are life spans, and are length, height, and
        weight. Are morals, values, judgments, goals, and are dreams. We have
        become dependent on other lives, and on technology. How much more will
        we depend on a computer to do for us? A computer already does almost
        everything a human can and more. Will we develop a computer with
        feelings, or a soul? That is about the only thing a computer does not
        have we do. I think we will develop more computer related material. I
        picture fewer jobs, because computers will do more and they will not
        have to be paid. I picture our vehicles being run by computers. No
        schools, because everyone will be schooled over the computer. So our
        human race will lack social skill, because we learn in school how to
        communicate with on another. I wonder will our governmental system be
        the same? Will we still be a republic? I don't think so, in the next
        century I think we will either be communist or there will be no
        governmental intervention at all. I picture a war; A war that we have
        created, when we created the first nuclear missiles and nuclear bomb.
        This war will be created because we slowly let go of our will to keep
        our world a safe, and nonviolent world. Violence, I predict, will
        greatly increase. We as a family, community, and nation will see
        bloodshed and violence everywhere. We already see more then are
        grandparents did. Do you think your ancestors saw kids walk into schools
        shooting? Do you think they saw mothers killing their newborns in
        m...The world today, more than ever, is a steadly shrinking planet, as
        new technology allows us to cross boundaries and attempt feats that were
        once only dreams of science fiction novelists. Yet, even as progress
        roots out old ways of life, and new technology makes obsolete time
        honored traditions, we never lose sight of the rich cultures to which
        our earth is home. Even today, the world is still a colorful and vibrant
        place, filled with a myriad of exotic cultures, each with its own unique
        and enthralling history and traditions. It is this increasing charm and
        fascination with the ancient that invariably draws the curiosity of
        outsiders. This fact has even permeated itself throughout my life. No
        matter where I go and wherever I end up, there is always some measure of
        curiosity concerning the other hemisphere of the world. Before and
        especially following any significant trip, I repeatedly face the same
        line of inquiry, “What is the Middle East like?”. To this question I
        have often respond with a casual and simple answer, “It’s okay”. Upon my
        return from the Middle East this past summer however, I began to feel
        this response horriblyinsufficient, and I decided to contemplate a more
        meaningful answer. I quickly came across amental block as I started
        thinking to myself, how could I ever possibly convey the sights, the
        sounds and the feelings of this region, so vibrant and culturally rich,
        to anyone who has not had the fortune to see it for themselves? Despite
        these difficulties, I began to draft my thoughts. In an attempt to bring
        in perspective the rich and inspiring heritage of the region, I
        progressively began to picture my most recent vacation to Arabia, and
        letting my memories take charge, I began describing to the best of my
        ability the highlights of my trip. Dawn crept up sluggishly the day I
        arrived in Saudi Arabia after my twenty-eight hour flight. After
        fighting, unsuccessfuly, for a few hours of some much needed sleep, I
        was just about to drift into doze off when the nearby mu’athin announced
        the dawn prayer, calling all faithful Muslims to their morning religious
        duty. Trying to turn over and sleep after an exhausting trip, I found my
        efforts compromised by the piercing bright desert sun that now edged
        over the horizon. Rousing myself from bed, I readied myself for the
        coming day, planing and imagining what each successive day would bring.
