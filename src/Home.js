      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        Thinking of our world today makes me wonder about tomorrow, a year, a
        decade, or a century later. I look back at what we did in the past and
        what we have accomplished as a race, a human race. It makes me realize
        how much can happen in a matter of years. What will happen in this next
        century? How advance will are technologies be then? How much of the
        world, as we know it, still be around? Will us humans be the same? We
        have changed in the years. Are life spans, and are length, height, and
        weight. Are morals, values, judgments, goals, and are dreams. We have
        become dependent on other lives, and on technology. How much more will
        we depend on a computer to do for us? A computer already does almost
        everything a human can and more. Will we develop a computer with
        feelings, or a soul? That is about the only thing a computer does not
        have we do. I think we will develop more computer related material. I
        picture fewer jobs, because computers will do more and they will not
        have to be paid. I picture our vehicles being run by computers. No
        schools, because everyone will be schooled over the computer. So our
        human race will lack social skill, because we learn in school how to
        communicate with on another. I wonder will our governmental system be
        the same? Will we still be a republic? I don't think so, in the next
        century I think we will either be communist or there will be no
        governmental intervention at all. I picture a war; A war that we have
        created, when we created the first nuclear missiles and nuclear bomb.
        This war will be created because we slowly let go of our will to keep
        our world a safe, and nonviolent world. Violence, I predict, will
        greatly increase. We as a family, community, and nation will see
        bloodshed and violence everywhere. We already see more then are
        grandparents did. Do you think your ancestors saw kids walk into schools
        shooting? Do you think they saw mothers killing their newborns in m...
